    Peter brings a fresh approach to his role of Principal Consultant with System Design and Communication Services. His is a diverse background, combining project management, engineering, health information management, business analyst, database
    programmer and IT support roles. As well, he has managed to fit in brief stints as a sound operator / theatre lighting operator / providing care to intellectually handicapped children, printer’s table hand and cash register systems programmer.
    Peter’s diverse background provides him with the ability to offer projects a further level of systems integration and propose practical solutions that can add value to a project.
  </p><p>
    Prior to establishing System Design & Communication Services, Peter served as Communications specialist and internal project manager for the major Consulting Engineering practice, WSP Lincolne Scott. He also served as IT Manager (and other roles)
    for Queensland Health, and was responsible for all aspects of ICT and telecommunications infrastructure in his region.
  </p><p>
    Peter has direct experience of a range of skills including strategic planning, master-planning, concept studies, technical design and solution implementation. He specialises in requirements-based specification of holistic systems for clients in
    healthcare, education, non-profit and commercial environments. Peter believes sustainable outcomes derive from a considered approach to the factors involved in each case and not necessarily from slavishly following “<em>the book</em>”. He also specialises
    in integrating technology solutions into other projects.
  </p><p>
    Peter was also a member of the NZ Green Building Council’s Technical Working Group responsible for developing NZ’s Education Rating Tool and was Accredited Professional of Record for the pilot implementation of Ormiston Senior College.
  </p><p>
    Peter’s work is characterised by his genuine commitment to each project and his disciplined approach. Peter believes in ensuring that systems support functional objectives as well as technical objectives.
